# Category Prediction in an Advertisement Website

The goal of this project is to create a machine-learning model that can accurately predict and categorize different types of content on an advertisement website, such as titles, descriptions, and full text. We are using a combination of classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), RandomForest, and XGBoost, as well as Natural Language Processing (NLP), to analyze real web data and improve content categorization. 
After testing, we found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier performed the best, meaning it was able to accurately predict and categorize content on the advertisement website more effectively than the other classifiers we used.
